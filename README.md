# Embed AI Agent
This is an exemplary NextJS project that showcases the integration of Voiceflow - a platform used to create and embed AI within a website - and an AI agent from there.

AI agents are support tools used to guide a user through a troubleshooting process and assist in resolved whatever issue they may have using a knowledgebase exposed to the agent itself.
